# Agent World

Agent World is an experimental, event-driven civilization simulator.

Its goal is to maximize civilization-level causal fidelity under finite compute and language-model budgets. Every person persists as an individual actor in the initial design, but most behavior runs through inexpensive executable strategies. Language models wake selectively for novel, uncertain, or potentially high-impact decisions.

The project does not aim to replay recorded history exactly. It aims to produce alternative histories whose individual behavior, institutions, technologies, and macro-level outcomes remain causally explainable under explicit human, material, and informational constraints.

## Status

The project is in its P0 foundation phase. Go is the provisional implementation language; slices S0–S2 provide stable simulation primitives and an immutable component read protocol, not a runnable simulation engine. The scheduler, world kernel, state commits, persistence, language-model integration, and survival behavior remain future work.

## Development

Go 1.24 or newer is required. The current foundation was validated with Go 1.24.13.

```sh
make fmt-check
make test
make race
make vet
make build
make bench
```

`make check` runs all gates except benchmarks. The module currently uses only the Go standard library.

## Material limitations

- A plausible simulated society is not evidence that the same policy will work in reality.
- Historical calibration tests mechanisms and distributions, not exact event reproduction.
- Unknown natural laws cannot be validated by language-model judgment alone.
- Self-modification remains versioned, tested, auditable, and reversible.
